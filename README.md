# Final-Year-Project
This project develops a machine learning model trained on gene expression patterns, specifically RNA sequencing data from the Gene Expression Omnibus dataset. This neural network model predicts the severity of fibromyalgia, a chronic pain disorder. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* Python 3.11.7
* Pip (Python package installer)

## Optional

- Anaconda (if you prefer to manage Python environments and dependencies with Conda)
- Jupyter Notebook (if you want to run the notebook interactively)

## Installation

To install the project dependencies and set up your environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   bash git clone https://github.com/amanataliraza/Final-Year-Project.git
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   cd Final-Year-Project
3. Create a Conda environment using the environment.yml file
  conda env create -f environment.yml
4. Activate the newly created environment
  conda activate base

## Usage

After installing the project dependencies and activating the environment, you can run the code:

Using Python script:
   
   python Code.py

The Jupyter Notebook or other server:

   jupyter notebook Code.ipynb

## Accessing the Hosted Website
